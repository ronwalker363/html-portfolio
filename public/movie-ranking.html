<P>This movie again comes with the best album of music and satisfactory screenplay and direction.This movie is meant for all those sad days thinking about your long lost love.</P>
<h3>MOUNA RAAGAM</h3>
<p>I find it funny how all the three movies i listed have turned into more or less around the same genre.To all those who wish to be lost in the 90s, this a perfect flim.</p>
